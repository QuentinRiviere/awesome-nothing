# Contributing to Awesome Nothing

We welcome your contributions to make this repository truly awesome! Please follow these guidelines to maintain the "nothing" quality that we all appreciate.

## Guidelines

- Maintain the spirit of "nothing." 
- If you think something is "too much of something," it probably doesn't belong here.
- Don't describe the "nothing," let it speak for itself.
- Limit your changes to one per pull request (PR).

## Example Listing

Given the nature of this repository, a proper example is hard to define. However, should you find a "nothing" worthy of addition, let it be as unassuming as possible. The art is in the unspoken.

- [Nothing](#) - An excellent example of nothing.

## To Add Nothing, You Must Remove Something

Maintaining a fine balance of "nothing" is crucial. Thus, for every new "nothing" you propose, please remove an existing "nothing" that you deem unfit for this repository. This could be a "nothing" that has turned into "something" or a "nothing" that's simply not "nothing" enough.

2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request.

Your pull request will be reviewed and, if it adheres to these guidelines, will be merged into the main repository. Thank you for contributing to the "nothingness" that is Awesome Nothing!
